Doctrine and Covenants;4
Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.
Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind, and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day. Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, charity, humility, diligence. Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find. Amen.
